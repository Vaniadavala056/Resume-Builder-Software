# Resume-Builder-Software
A resume builder software using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to create professional resumes directly in the browser. HTML provides the structure, using forms and input fields for personal information, education, experience, and skills. CSS styles the page to ensure an attractive and user-friendly layout. JavaScript enables dynamic interactions, such as adding or removing sections (e.g., work experience, skills) and validating the data entered by the user. The software can also allow users to download or print the final resume in a preferred format, such as PDF. This approach simplifies the resume creation process and ensures consistency across different browsers.
